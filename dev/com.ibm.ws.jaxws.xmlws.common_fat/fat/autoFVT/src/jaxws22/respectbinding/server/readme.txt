Each directory contains a slightly varying service.

The names of the directories need to match the names of the tests in
the service side tests. 

Ant will build an app corresponding to each directory.
 (we need to write that too, later)

The service side test case will check to see which apps 
have deployed or not to establish if we are processing respectbinding
correctly.
