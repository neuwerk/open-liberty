	@ONeway 
		should not generate wsdl when @WebMethod missing.
		
    webservicepackagemapping - simply won't work in no package test case
    
    webserviceinterfacemapping - need to write this in pass 2.		

    @WebService 
    serviceName param is not allowed on interface, but spec doesn't say this. - yes it does, mr2 #32
    
    behavior of annotation is different between if and class, shouldn't be.
      - servicename has to be declared on class - ok, mr2 #32
      - name can't be declared on interface or class, usage is lost
      - portname, if null on if, causes no porttypes to be generated in wsdl.
      - fully qual'd package name of interface must be spec'd, even if imported.
      
    tooling doesn't map inherited methods to wsdl (webservice_g2.inheritance)  
    
    When a wsdl is supplied in the dep. descriptor and war file, but is the
    wrong wsdl, service fails to deploy.  What should happen is wsdl should
    be generated.  8.9.06    
        
    @WebParam - runtime
      - service doesn't catch changed annotation params on mode, partname, and lets
        client invoke the service.  I wonder if these parms are only
        examined when generating wsdl.  
        
   @WebResult
   	testJava2Wsdl4(), testWsdl2Java1() - partname and name - partname should override, but it doesn't appear
   	anywhere. May be because ri is incapbile of generating the bare parameter style to which
   	this applies. ref 224 sec 2.3.1.
   	
   @WebFault - if Exception is annotated but params not explicitly defined, wsgen
               reads this, processes it correctly, but resulting wsdl is BAD as
               name and namespace are the empty string, and it doesn't catch this,
               but wsimport can't process the wsdl.
               
   @WebFault - Both the exception class and a method in the implementation bean is annotated.
               operationName (@WebMethod) and name (@WebFault) attributes specify the
               same name. java2wsdl (wsgen) tool generated a wsdl file, which has two
               messages with the exact same name attribute. This is conflicting with the
               WSDL 1.1 spec stating that "The message name attribute provides a unique 
               name among all messages defined within the enclosing WSDL document."
               
   @HandlerChain - JSR-181 states that "The @HandlerChain annotation MAY be present
   				   on the endpoint interface and service implementation bean. 
   				   The service implementation bean’s @HandlerChain is used if 
   				   @HandlerChain is present on both." But, for the case where the anno
   				   is present on both, the IF's @HandlerChain is used. This is the opposite 
   				   what the spec is saying.
