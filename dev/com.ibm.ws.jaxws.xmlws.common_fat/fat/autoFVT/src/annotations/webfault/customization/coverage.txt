This service again is based on AddNumbers service. This time, the service has
two methods, one for addition and one for multiplication. Both throws WebFaultCustomizatinException
when any or the arguments is negative. On the client side, the wsdl I use to generate the jax-ws
 artifacts
specifies a wsdl customization. The customization changes the fault name of the multiplication method
to MultiplyNumbersException. So the expected behavior is that the client should be able to catch 
a "MultiplyNumbersException" when it invokes the multiplication method with a negative integer.
This worked with RI, and as far as the tooling goes everything is fine. wsimport generates the
exception beans for "MultiplyNumbersException".

The test cases check if the client catches the proper exception for each method on the service.
