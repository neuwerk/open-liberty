   Description:
     The purpose of this file is to provide a wrapper around the files we used
     to import with entity references, so we can use the ant import task instead,
     while retaining backward compatibility with older tests that still use the
     entity ref imports.

     The ant import task gives us the ability to override properties and targets,
     which can be useful for customizing tests, and cleans up the build files
     a bit.
